  ##HOW IT WORKS
  
### The backend is all "Ruby on Rails" using SQlite3 for the database engine and 
uses Activerecord for the Database Object Relational Mapping or (ORM).
 
### The frontend uses HTML for <ERB> render tags and routing for each page and uses CSS for the basic 
coloring, fonts and styling.
